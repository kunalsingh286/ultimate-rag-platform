# 🚀 Ultimate RAG Platform

## Overview
A production-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform built using
open-source Large Language Models, designed to provide accurate, grounded
answers from private documents with full observability and evaluation.

This project demonstrates real-world Applied LLM Engineering and LLMOps
practices without relying on paid APIs.

## Key Features
- Document ingestion (PDF, Markdown, Text)
- Chunking and semantic embeddings
- Vector-based retrieval using Qdrant
- Context-grounded LLM responses
- Structured JSON outputs
- Streaming responses
- Prompt versioning and regression testing
- Retrieval and answer faithfulness evaluation
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

## Tech Stack
- LLMs: Mistral / LLaMA / Qwen (via Ollama)
- Embeddings: BGE / Instructor (HuggingFace)
- Vector Database: Qdrant
- Backend API: FastAPI
- UI: Streamlit
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana

## Why This Project
LLMs alone are unreliable for enterprise use. This project focuses on building
a reliable, observable, and evaluatable RAG system that minimizes hallucinations
and can be safely deployed in production environments.

## Project Status
🚧 Phase 0 — Repository initialization and architecture planning
